Instructions & Expected output
*please note, at this time (03/02/2021), each script produces additional plots.
Upon acceptance, these will be relocated.
Expected run-time:
1. spDist_behavioralAnalysis (Figure 1)
Sections denote portions of Figure 1. Ensure behavioral data is accessible by 'root'. Eye data shared herein has been extracted, preprocessed, and scored by iEye_ts (github/tommysprague/iEye_ts). To plot aligned eye traces (1B) and scatter plot (1C; takes > 10 mins), set scatterplot_1BC = 1. Supplementary Figure 1 data is also given by this script.
2. spDist_plotHRFs_ERA_pRFvoxSelection_btwnRFstats (Figure 2)
Change spDist_loadRoot to location where extracted neural data has been stored locally. 4th input argument, 'alignment' defaults to target position. To recreate Figure 2c (distractor aligned Rf in vs out), set alignment argument to 'dist_ang_all'.
3. spDist_plotBasis,  spDist_exampleTrial.m (Figure 3)
4. spDist_plotReconstructions_condAlign. Will plot 3 separate plots for Figure 4 A (distractor absent, target aligned) B (distractor present, target algined), & C (distractor present, distractor aligned)(Figure 4). To obtain statistical results examining fidelity on a TR basis, compared to a null-distritbuion, run spDist_fidelity_stats_shuf.m.
5. spDist_epochFidelity_statsShuf.m (Figure 5)
requires GAT model to be performed on data, which can be obtained by running spDist_channelRespAmp_GAT_figure4.m
5. spDist_modelCompare (Figure 6)
relies on GAT trained data generated by spDist_channelRespAmp_GAT, saved with _epochTPTs.m
6. spDist_neuralBehavCorr (Figure 7)
